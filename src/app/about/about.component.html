                <p>
                    I'm currently a junior Computer Science and Statistics major at UC Davis. I've been
                    for over 7 years and it has now become one of my most passionate hobbies! Outside of
                    coding you can find me at the gym, getting boba, or just hanging with friends.

            <h1>My Coding Journey</h1>
            <div class="body">
                <p>
                    In 5th grade, I logged into Code.org for the first time, gaining my first ever
                    introduction to coding. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 7th grade, I started learning the basics of web development with HTML, CSS, and 
                    Javascript through CodeAcademy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 9th grade, I attended my first hackathon, rapidly boosting my interest in coding.
                    I was encouraged to learn the basics of iOS development and started to gain proficiency
                    throughout the year.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 10th grade, I started to extend my interest through starting to work on my own
                    projects, mostly iOS applications. I also decided to pursue this academically, enrolling
                    AP Computer Science and deciding to follow my school's CS pathway.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 11th grade, I attended more hackathons and even won one early in the year. I started to
                    experiment with more complex technologies, attempting to integrate machine learning and 
                    databases with my mobile applications.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 12th grade, I decided to transition this interest into a career, deciding to enroll at 
                    UC Davis for Computer Science. This was when I gained my first professional experience with
                    coding as a Web Development instructor at a local tutoring center.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In my 1st year of college, I took many introductory classes and furthered my conceptual
                    programming knowledge. During this year, I first started applying to internships and was
                    able to secure my first SWE internship at Chevron.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In my 2nd year of college, I continued with intermediate level computer science courses and
                    took an introductory statistics course for fun. I enjoyed that course so much that I decided
                    to pursue statistics as an additional major. It was this year that I started to gain a strong
                    interest in Data Science and Machine Learning.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In my 3rd year of college, I am taking many advanced CS and Statistics courses, building on
                    my expertise in these domains. Furthermore, I've gained a significant interest in web
                    development and trained myself to be a full-stack developer.
